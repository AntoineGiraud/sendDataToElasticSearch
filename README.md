# sendDataToElasticSearch

Python script to send data (.csv, ...) to elasticsearch v1.7.3

*Note: made for now for ElasticSearch v1.7.3 as in v2 you can't update the mapping of only one type. You have to start all over again by deleting the index and all his data, then add your mapping, then re add your data.*

here is an exemple of some data & their mapping used in [Defi VÃ©lo MTL](http://www.defivelomtl.com/) challenge
